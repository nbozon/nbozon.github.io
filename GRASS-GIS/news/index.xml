      <description>Hey GRASS GIS friends!
We just launched a crowd funding campaign to partially cover the costs of refreshing and re-styling our website https://grass.osgeo.org to newer standards.
Details about our plans for the website migration in 2019 can find on the wiki: https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Website_migration_plan_2019
For the realization we need your support, any contribution counts and is most welcome ! You can easily contribute any amount through our PayPal money pool: https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/86YKZiIEPV
Thank you very much for your support</description>

      <description>SVN to GitHub migration has been started today.
SVN has been set to read-only mode and we are currently updating the new GitHub repos.
We are tracking all efforts here: https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GitMigration
Much time of the GRASS GIS Community Sprint Berlin 2019 will be dedicated to complete the migration. Further steps will include: some needed source code updates, migration of trac issues, add labels to the issues in GitHub, migration of the trac wiki, extensive aftermath clean-up (Travis CI/CD setting update, email notifications, IRC notifications, cronjobs, fixing links in the website and grasswiki, etc.</description>
